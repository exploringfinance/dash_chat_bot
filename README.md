## Python Dash LLM User Interface

This repo contains code needed to run a Dash app using the Claude2 model from Anthropic. To deploy the app yourself, you will need an AWS account with credentials for a user that has been approved to use Bedrock. You can get full instructions in [this article](https://www.altanalyticsllc.com/posts/2023-10-15-aws-llm-chatbot/).

To view the app deployed on Posit Cloud, follow this [link](https://posit.cloud/content/6811799) (you need a Posit Cloud account). You can also see a public version on Heroku [here](https://alt-analytics-chat-bot-47d36be32fc4.herokuapp.com).

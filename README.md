## Python Dash LLM User Interface

This repo contains code needed to run a Dash app using the Claude2 model from Anthropic. To deploy the app yourself, you will need an AWS account with credentials for a user that has been approved to use Bedrock. You can get full instructions in [this article](https://www.altanalyticsllc.com/posts/2023-06-10-us-debt-analysis/).

To view the app deployed on Posit Cloud, follow this [link](). Reach out to [tony@altanalyticsllc.com](mailto:tony@altanalyticsllc.com) if you have any questions.
